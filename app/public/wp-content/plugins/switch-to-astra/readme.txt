This plugin essentially helps you make your existing website compatible with Page Builders when you switch to Astra theme.

== Description ==

- Did you just install Astra theme on your existing website? 
- Do you have any layouts built with Page Builders that are no more Full Width after switching to Astra?
- Wondering whether you need to manually make all these pages full width manually from Astra meta option? 

If the answer to questions above is yes, this plugin is for you. 

Here is how it works â€“

- Install & Activate the plugin
- Click on the Link: "Go Fullwidth"
- In a moment, the pages & posts where you've used the Page Builder will go full width.

This is what this plugin automates:

1. Finds and shortlists all layouts that are created with Page Builder.
2. The layout of all those pages is changed to "Full Width" from meta options.
3. Title is be disabled
4. Sidebar will be set to "No Sidebar"
5. Featured Image will be disabled
